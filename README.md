# Bash Setup and Starship Configuration 

### My `bash` Setup

This repository contains all the aliases and settings I use as my daily driver, including the config file for Starship.

I should mention that these scripts aren't completely written by me; they are from multiple sources I've found over the time I've been using Linux.


- *If you find certain parts of the scripts confusing or unhelpful, feel free to modify or remove them for your own use.*
- *I'm open to any suggestions that you find useful and that could help others with their setups.*

### Usage

1. First, clone this repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IrregularCelery/setup.bash
```

2. Then, make the `install.sh` script executable: <sup><sub>(of course, after you've read the file content)</sub></sup>
 
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

3. To use the `starship.toml` file, you also need to install **Starship**:

```bash
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
```
For more information, visit the [Starship documentation](https://starship.rs/).
